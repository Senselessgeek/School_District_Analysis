##Short Story
Charter schools are clearly doing something good, following that principle of "do more with less". While receiving roughly $38K less than public schools, they also proved a high average student grade. There is more data that would be necessary to come to a definitive conclusion, such as teach count, teacher salary, courses offered, etc. This would provide a better insight into why charter schools are able to prove better grades on less funding.
